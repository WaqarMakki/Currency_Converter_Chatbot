# Currency_Converter_Chatbot
I created a ChatBot that gives most of the responses with anime quotes and also converts a currency to another required from currency. This project was made using Dialogflow and backend created using Flask. For currency conversion a free and limited api was used.


This code is only the backend developed in Flask. It needs to be connected with Dialogflow in order for it to work.
